# Raspberry PI Magic Mirror
Nowadays, many people will wake up and look at their phone to catch up on everything that they need, such as the time, weather, news, and many more. They also will go and possibly look at their mirror. This project combines both into one, allowing for easy access to all the info one needs in the morning.

# First Milestone: Setting up the Raspberry PI, a VNC server, as well as adding the Magic Mirror software
Since this was the first time, I have ever used a Raspberry Pi, I decided that learning how to turn it on was a good starting point. If you know Raspberry Pi, then starting up for the first time is a simple process: just downloading the raspberry pi imager, stick in a SD card, and write it up. Since I had a monitor, it was a simple task of plugging in the newly written SD card, adding the power supply, a HDMI cable, a mouse and keyboard, and with that the Raspberry pi is set up. Setting up the VNC server was a bit harder. A VNC server is a program that allows me to remotely access my Raspberry Pi, creating a virtual desktop.

# Second Milestone
As my project was to make a smart mirror using a Raspberry Pi, it is fitting that I make my second milestone setting up the magic mirror software and all the modules that I want to add. I decided on using an insult module from https://github.com/mykle1/MMM-Insults instead of a compliments module that is from the default modules. I also replaced the news module for the insult one, as the news module took up the space I wanted to use for the insult module.
